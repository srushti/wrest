Features under the section marked 'Current' are completed but pending release as a gem. If you need any of these, you'll need to use the latest source from the git repository.

Features under a numbered section are complete and available in the Wrest gem.

== Current

== 1.0.0.beta3
 * GH#13 Works for get and delete with parameters appended to the uri string and 
   with ? and no parameters appended to the uri string
 * GH#26 'http://localhost'.to_uri['foo/bar'] fails
 * GH#11 Handle gem dependencies using bundler
 * GH#22 Converts Uri to UriTemplate
 * GH#23 Supports extension of UriTemplate via #[]
 
== 1.0.0.beta2
 * GH#2 Make Components::Containers hash store a HashWithIndifferentAccess
 * GH#6 Net::HTTP based calls to Twitter public APIs fail
 * GH#5 Patron (curl) support failing for responses where headers have multiple values
 * GH#7 Build fails on Ruby 1.9
 * GH#16 Remove jeweler and use .gemspec direcly
 
== 1.0.0.beta1
 * If libxml-ruby isn't found but nokogiri, don't warn about libxml-ruby

== 1.0.0.beta0
 * Dependencies updated to ActiveSupport 3.0.0.rc and RSpec 2.0.0.beta19

== 0.1.2
 * Locked gem dependencies to ActiveSupport 2.3.8 and rspec 1.3.0 to avoid breakages caused by inadvertently requiring the Rails 3.0 and Rspec 2.0 gems which have changed greatly

== 0.1.1
 * Multipart post and put using Net::Http

== 0.1.0
 * Added Nokogiri as a fallback for LibXML Ruby before we give up and use REXML. (Nokogiri is available on JRuby, unlike LibXML-ruby)
 * Added code to attempt to load JREXML (for what it's worth) when using REXML on JRuby
 * Ensure that Wrest throws an exception when an actual request is made in a test environment in Rails (RAILS_ENV == 'test')
 * Support for keep-alive connections via Wrest::Http::Session and Wrest::Http::Response#connection_closed?
 * Create two convenience Post methods on Uri - one for application/x-www-form-urlencoded and the other normal
 * Optional libcurl implementations of the Request/Response classes (for those on MRI who need better performance). See examples/delicious.rb, examples/facebook.rb. Note that while there is a great deal of API compatibility, everything may not behave exactly the same under libcurl. Please do report inconsistencies.
 * Added live functional tests to codebase (rake spec:functional, needs spec/functional/sample_rails_app running on port 3000)
 
== 0.0.9
 * Added redirect follow support for GET requests (see examples/redirection.rb)
 * Auto redirection limit
 * Request timeout limit config
 * Added an alias_accessor macro to allow alternative names for attribute accessors (see examples/wow_realm_status.rb) 
 * Removed the need to explicitly include AttributesContainer::Typecaster or to use the enable_typecasting_support macro. The call to typecast now does this for us. See AttributesContainer#typecast and AttributesContainer::Typecaster#typecast
   
== 0.0.8
 * Added URI extension using the [] method (see examples/delicious.rb)
 * Refactored out Request as the first step to adding Response caching
